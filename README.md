# weatherApp
##Introduction This is a simple website that allows one to look at the weather at cities around the world. The main focus was to learn how to use an API(in this case, openWeather). This assignment also gave me practice using local storage and Javascript. Additionally, I designed my own icons using Adobe Illustrator. I was aiming for a clean, calming look- but unfortunately the specifications required more information that needed to be included on the site (like wind, humidity and past searches). I also included animation- make sure you chose a city with a clear day!

##Technologies Bootstrap 4, JS, openWeather, Adobe Illustrator, localStorage
